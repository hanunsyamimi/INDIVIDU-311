<center> <h3>  GALERI PANTAI TIMUR </h3></center>

<center> <p  style="margin: 50px 100px 60px 100px;">

I worked as a secretary at Galeri Pantai Timur in Kuantan after finishing my SPM. It belonged to a friend of my mother's. I just have to deal with the paintings, events, and meetings, as well as maintain the premises tidy. I also learn how to sketch a portrait step by step and discover more about the art. I learned a lot from my bosses and the other artists that came to the gallery to teach me this and that. I am grateful since I have gained new information, despite the fact that I am more interested in doodling than portraits. At the very least, I now understand the fundamentals and will be able to practise more in my spare time. When you're alone with the paintings, it may be extremely frightening since it feels as if the artwork is gazing at you. Overall, it was one of the nicest working experiences I've ever had. </p> </center>
